Custom ARM-Cortex M4 STM32F446 flight computer for UAVs

Changes I would make on next revision:
- ESD protection of reverse polarity protection mosfet
- More jumpers, for example on the M9N to select active or passive antenna
- Larger inductor pads or different inductor to make it easier to solder
- Larger crystal pads for handsoldering (but idk if handsoldering crystal is possible)
